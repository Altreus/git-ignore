git-ignore
----------

This script creates a .gitignore file in your current repository, or in your
current directory if you're not currently in a repository.

It uses http://www.gitignore.io to get the ignore files.

If you put it in your `$PATH` then you can invoke it as `git ignore`.

    git ignore vim perl

You can also use the `GITIGNORE_GROUPS` environment variable to specify those
groups that should always be included

    GITIGNORE_GROUPS=vim,autotools git ignore perl python

The selected items will be concatenated onto your current .gitignore; use
`--clobber` to avoid this. Be sure to add `--` to prevent your first item from
being interpreted as the argument to clobber.

    git ignore --clobber -- vim perl

This requirement will go away with a new version of Opt::Imistic.
